### **Introduction to Generative Models**

Generative models aim to model the probability distribution of data in order to generate new instances that are similar to the training data. These models have applications in various fields, including image synthesis, text generation, and data augmentation. The key idea is to learn the distribution \( p(x) \) from the data and then sample from this distribution to generate new data.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Latent Space:** Generative models often map input data into a latent spaceâ€”a lower-dimensional representation from which new data can be generated.
2. **Likelihood Estimation:** Generative models estimate the likelihood of data under a particular distribution.
3. **Training Objective:** Typically involves optimizing a function that aligns the generated data distribution with the real data distribution.

### **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**

**Overview:**
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that combines principles from autoencoders and probabilistic graphical models. VAEs aim to model the distribution of data by learning a latent representation.

**Components:**
1. **Encoder:** Maps input data \( x \) to a latent space \( z \). It outputs the parameters of a probability distribution (usually Gaussian) in the latent space.
2. **Decoder:** Takes a latent variable \( z \) and reconstructs the input data \( x \). It generates data by sampling from the latent space.
3. **Latent Variable:** The latent variable \( z \) represents the compressed version of the input data, capturing its essential features.

**Objective:**
The VAE is trained to maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) on the log-likelihood of the data. The ELBO is composed of two parts:
1. **Reconstruction Loss:** Measures how well the decoder reconstructs the input data from the latent variable.
2. **KL Divergence:** Measures how closely the learned latent variable distribution approximates a prior distribution (usually Gaussian).

**Key Features:**
- **Probabilistic:** Models the uncertainty in the data generation process.
- **Latent Space:** Provides a structured latent space that can be sampled to generate new data.

### **Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE)**

**Overview:**
Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) extend VAEs by conditioning the generative process on additional information. This allows for more control over the generated samples.

**Components:**
1. **Condition:** Includes additional information \( y \) (such as labels or other attributes) along with the input data \( x \).
2. **Conditional Encoder:** Maps the input data \( x \) and the condition \( y \) to a latent space \( z \).
3. **Conditional Decoder:** Generates the output data \( x \) given the latent variable \( z \) and the condition \( y \).

**Objective:**
The objective remains similar to VAEs but incorporates the condition \( y \). The ELBO is optimized to ensure that the reconstruction is accurate given both the latent variable and the condition.

**Key Features:**
- **Control:** Allows for generating samples with specific attributes or conditions.
- **Flexibility:** Can be used in various applications where conditioning on external information is useful (e.g., image-to-image translation).

### **Quantile Variational Autoencoders (QVE)**

**Overview:**
Quantile Variational Autoencoders (QVE) are a variant of VAEs designed to model data distributions more robustly, particularly in cases where data distributions are skewed or heavy-tailed.

**Components:**
1. **Quantile Function:** Instead of modeling the mean of the data distribution, QVE models quantiles (e.g., median, quartiles) to capture different aspects of the distribution.
2. **Quantile Loss:** The loss function is adapted to focus on the quantiles, which helps in better handling skewed distributions.

**Objective:**
QVE aims to learn a quantile-based distribution that provides a more accurate representation of data, especially in scenarios where traditional VAEs might struggle with skewed or multi-modal distributions.

**Key Features:**
- **Robustness:** Handles complex data distributions by focusing on quantile-based loss functions.
- **Improved Modeling:** Better suited for datasets with non-standard distributions compared to standard VAEs.

### **Summary**

- **Generative Models:** Learn to generate new data by modeling the distribution of a dataset.
- **VAE:** Combines autoencoders and probabilistic models to learn latent representations and generate data.
- **CVAE:** Extends VAE by conditioning on additional information for more controlled data generation.
- **QVE:** Focuses on quantile-based loss functions for improved modeling of complex or skewed distributions.

Each of these models has its strengths and applications, depending on the nature of the data and the specific goals of the generative task.
